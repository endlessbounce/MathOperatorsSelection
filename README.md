The program implements BestFitInt interface.
It receives a string of numbers and desired result at input,
operates on the string with all possible combinations of math operations to get expected number at the output.

fitPlusMinus method uses only addition and substraction.
fit is same as fitPlusMinus, but also uses multiplication and division.
fitBraces same as both above, but can place parentheses (pending implementation).
